# Conductivity_Predictor_from_IOT-_sensors
*  Water conductivity is directly related to the concentration of ions in the water. These ions come from dissolved salts and other inorganic materials.
*  In this project, I compared the Root Mean Squared Errors (RMSEs) of Artificial Nueral Network (ANN) and Multivariable Linear Regression (MLR) models in predicting the Conductivity of Recycled Water
*  The observations used in this model were recorded from IOT sensors
*  The bar plot below shows the features and how they correlate with the target variable (Conductivty)
*  The RMSEs of both the ANN and MLR are 29.2 and 28.8 respectively. Therefore, there is no significant difference in the performance of both models.
*  In this case the MLR will be selected since it requires lesser computational resources, faster, and can be easily deployed.
*  Below is the scatterplot of the Actual Conductivity Test data vs the Predicted Conductivity data
